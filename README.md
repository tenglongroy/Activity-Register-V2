This is a revamp of my first Python Flask project (named as activity_register in my Github), whose interface is rebuilt by applying Material Design style guideline and using its framework, also improved the interface using Ajax and refined the functionalities of MySQL database.

This project will later be uploaded to http://tenglongroy.pythonanywhere.com/ after some customisations for PythonAnywhere are made and replace the existing Activity Register V1.
