the count for joined users doesn't work if is_join in joinlist is 0

select al.*, userlist.nickname, CAST(COALESCE(sum(joinlist.is_join), 0) as signed) as total
            from activitylist al
            left join joinlist on al.act_id = joinlist.act_id
            join userlist on userlist.user_id=al.maker_id
            group by al.act_id;

select al.act_id, al.title, userlist.nickname, COALESCE(sum(joinlist.is_join), 0)
from activitylist al
left join joinlist on al.act_id = joinlist.act_id
join userlist on userlist.user_id=al.maker_id
group by al.act_id;
